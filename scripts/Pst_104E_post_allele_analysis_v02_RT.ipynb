    "#### Overview\n",
    "1. Reads in the large allele DataFrames generated in `DK_0911_defining_alleles_v02` (i.e. proteinortho hits OR best blast hit) - see description header cell in that notebook for more information on which alleles are included in that DataFrame.\n",
    "2. Filters the allele DataFrames based on %ID and %QCov (this can be set to filter only BLAST-identified alleles or both BLAST- and proteinortho-identified alleles) so that distance information is not calculated on an unnecessarily large number of alleles.\n",
    "3. Calculates distance & dN/dS information, and saves this to an output file so that it does not have to be re-calculated (if for whatever reason, the inputs change so that dN/dS or distance information should change, this output file (`DK_0911_v0x_analysed_alleles.df`) should be deleted so that it can be re-generated.\n",
    "4. Plots graphs of allele-type distribution (pie chart) and allele-type Levenshtein distances (measures of similarity) for different levels of allele-filtering (QCov/TCov/%ID/Levenshtein similarity).\n",
