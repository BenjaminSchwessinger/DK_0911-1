    "The program tries to count how many neighbours of an allele pair are in the same orthogroup. This requires first to anchor the allele pairing e.g. find out what the 1:1 allele is and then walk outward to see if each others neighbours are in the same orthogroup. We can run this simple without allowing for skips and in simple=Flase mode to allow for a skip by one.\n",

The initial outcome is an array of length n where 1 represents a orthology mathch, where 0 represents not an orthology match and where np.nan represents the lack of test for orthology match (e.g. where one of the genes is at the edge of a contig). These arrays can be converted in tuples, where the first is number of observed matches (sum of 1s) and where the second value is the number of possible values (0 and 1 == non np.nan in the array).  \n",
